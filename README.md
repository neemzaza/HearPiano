# HearPiano
This is an app about music training by gameplay interactive. Also, this app is a winner app in Swift Student Challenge 2025 by Apple!

**HearPiano developed and made by Sarut Ardnarong**<br>
Every user that want to practice their note hearing skill will get the best experience with this app because we present it to you with the gameplay that you are "Piano tuner Job" with different out of tune pattern each round.

**Little story about this app**<br>
This app created by inspire of Piano and App/Web Development. Before challenge start, My piano is out of tune then I have a chance to see a technical process of piano tuning by my piano tuner. This event inspired me.
But! I don't have any experience in Swift. At first I was thinking it was too late for making app without any experience but I think "Let me try it!". I had learnt Swift since first day of open submission of Swift Student Challenge. I was practicing every every day in my classroom (in free time of class), after come to home and submitted on two days before submission close!

**What did I learn in this event?**<br>
- Best plan of development is important! I removed many feature that I making because it too much for 3 minutes interactive of app. I decided to keep best idea and feature of this app instead.
- Be creative is also important for this challenge. Be creative of idea that your making.

This event motivates me to try to coding and learning Swift with myself. And everything is possible to making and happening.
